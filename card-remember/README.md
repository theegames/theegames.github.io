# [Memory Crossing](https://mendesnathanj.github.io/memory-crossing/)

## What it is
This is a small memory puzzle game that is themed off of the popular Animal Crossing video game series.

Memory is a simple kids game that I grew up with so I'm quite fond of it.

However, I wanted it to potentially appeal to people of all ages which is why I included a streak system that encourages a player to not begin flipping pairs over until they can recall where a large amount of cards are if they want to get the most points out of the game.


## Technology Stack
- Vanilla JS
- Webpack

## Features
How the game works:
  - Flip cards over by clicking on them two at a time. If those cards are a pair, then you will earn bells (points) and they will stay up. If not, then they will go back down.
  - Keep flipping until you find all the matching pairs before time runs out!
  - Earn bonus points by flipping matching pairs over consecutively.
  - Increasing difficulty by adding more cards to the board up to 3 levels
  - Running out of time to complete a level will bring you back down to the previous level

## Future Directions
Future features for this app include but are not limited to:
- Adding more points to the total for completing the game more quickly
